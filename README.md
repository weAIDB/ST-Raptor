## ‚ú® Project Introduction

**ST-Raptor** is a tool for answering questions over Excel tables with diverse layouts. It takes only an Excel-formatted table and a natural language question as input, and produces precise answers.

Unlike many existing approaches, ST-Raptor requires no additional fine-tuning. It combines a vision-language model (VLM) with a tree-construction algorithm (HO-Tree) and flexibly integrates with different LLMs. ST-Raptor employs a two-stage validation mechanism to ensure reliable results.

</p>

**Semi-structures tables like personal information form, academic tables, financial tables... from Excel, websites (HTML), Markdown, csv files...**

## üíª SSTQA Benchmark

The **102** tables and **764** questions in SSTQA are carefully curated from over **2031** real-world tables by considering $(i)$ tables featuring semi-structured formats, such as nested cells, multi-row/column headers, irregular layouts and $(ii)$ coverage across **19** representative real scenarios.

We list out 10 representative real scenarios as below:

Human Resources, Corporate Management, Financial Management, Marketing, Warehouse Management, Academic, Schedule Management, Application Forms, Education-related, and Sales Management.

Download the unfiltered dataset with 2k+ tables: [Raw Dataset]().

## üìä Performance

The following table demonstrates the answering accuracy (%) and ROUGE-L score of different methods over our collected SSTQA benchmark and other two benchmarks.

Note that the required question answering is highly dependent on both the semi-structured table complexity and the question complexity.

## üïπ Quick Start

#### 1. Clone Repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:weAIDB/ST-Raptor.git
cd ST-Raptor
```

##### Please download this repository.

#### 2. Environment & Benchmark & Model

**Environment.**

1. Use the following command to install the conda environment.

```bash
# create virtual environment
conda create -n straptor python=3.10
conda activate straptor
# install required packages
pip install -m requirements.txt
```

2. Install the HTML rendering plugin wkhtmltox.

```shell
wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6.1-2/wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-2.jammy_amd64.deb
sudo apt install -f ./wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-2.jammy_amd64.deb
```

**Benchmark**

1. Download the SSTQA with the link [SSTQA Benchmark](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LkdxJHJfThNUiEh68YdgkN_eNbJEoRJ7/view?usp=sharing) and save in ./data

2. Change the settings in ./main.py

```python
# You need to change this
input_jsonl = 'PATH_TO_YOUR_INPUT_JSONL'
table_dir = 'PATH_TO_YOUR_TABLE_DIR'
output_jsonl = 'PATH_TO_YOUR_OUTPUT_JSONL'
log_dir = 'PATH_TO_YOUR_LOG_DIR'
```

The Q&A data is stored in a JSONL format file, and the format of each record is as follows.
```json
{
	"id": "XXX", 
	"table_id": "XXX", 
	"query": "XXX", 
	"label": "XXX"
}
```

**Model Configuration.**
The model configuration in our paper includes Deepseek-V3 (LLM API) + InternVL2.5 26B (VLM) + Multilingual-E5-Large-Instruct (Embedding Model). This configuration requires a total of approximately 160GB of GPU memory. You can replace the model according to the hardware situation or change it to use APIs.

[Download InternVL2.5](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL2_5-26B) [Download Multilingual-E5](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct)

You need to set model configuration in /utils/constnts.py

```python
# Set your LLM api
API_URL = "YOUR_LLM_API_URL"
API_KEY = "YOUR_LLM_API_KEY"

# If you use local deployed LLM, set this
LLM_PORT = YOUR_LLM_PORT
LLM_MODEL_TYPE = YOUR_LLM_MODEL_NAME

# Set your local deployed VLM api, we use vllm as default
VLM_PORT = YOUR_VLM_PORT
VLM_MODEL_TYPE = YOUR_VLM_MODEL_NAME

# Your model path to MUltilingual-E5 model
MULTILINGUAL_E5_MODEL_PATH = "YOUR_MODEL_PATH"
```

If you want to use other format of apis, please revise the code in ./utils/api_utils.py

**InternVL2.5 Deployment**

We use vLLM to deploy InternVL2.5 as an example.

1. Install the vllm package.

```shell
pip install vllm
```

2. Denote the GPU and deploy the VLM.

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
--model=PATH_TO_INTERNVL \
--port 8138 \
--trust-remote-code \
--max-num-batched-tokens 8192 \
--seed 42 \
--tensor-parallel-size 4
```

#### Question Answering !

If you have completed all the above settings, use the following command to start execution

```shell
python ./main.py
```
